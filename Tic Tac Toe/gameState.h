//Abstract class:
//Abstract classes are used to represent general concepts (for example, Shape), which can be used as 
//  base classes for concrete classes (for example, Circle).
//  No objects of an abstract class can be created. Abstract types cannot be used as parameter types, 
//  as function return types, or as the type of an explicit conversion. Pointers and references to an 
//  abstract class can be declared.
//
//Game States include:
//   Intro
//   Title Screen
//   Play
//   Game Over
